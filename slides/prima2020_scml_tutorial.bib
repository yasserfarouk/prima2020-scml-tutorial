abstract = "Automated negotiation is one of the most common approaches used to make decisions and manage disputes between computational entities leading them to optimal agreements. Many existing works tackle single-issue negotiations and the negotiation environment is assumed to be static so that the agents can make decisions based solely on the proposals of the counterparts and their own fixed parameters. Most real-world scenarios, however, involve complex domains and dynamic environments. In such cases, it is no longer sufficient to consider negotiation as an isolated activity in a static environment. Therefore, a more general framework for automated negotiation is needed in which the negotiation agents can be very flexible and adaptive. In this paper, we describe a generic framework for automated negotiation, which captures descriptively the social dynamics of the negotiation process. The proposed framework enables the agents to behave responsively to the changes in the environment. Their strategies can adapt as the conditions outside of the negotiation change to ensure that their decisions remain rational. And the agents are proactive and responsive by searching for options, which are outside of the negotiation and which may improve their outcomes. The key ideas and the overall system architecture together with a specific negotiation instance in a basic bilateral setting are described, along with two illustrative examples. The first example is in the context of e-commerce, and the second example is an application scenario of service level agreement negotiation in service computing. We also describe a prototypical implementation of the proposed negotiation framework."

abstract = "There are many experimental studies of bargaining behavior, but suprisingly enough nearly no attempt has been made to investigate the so-called ultimatum bargaining behavior experimentally. The special property of ultimatum bargaining games is that on every stage of the bargaining process only one player has to decide and that before the last stage the set of outcomes is already restricted to only two results. To make the ultimatum aspect obvious we concentrated on situations with two players and two stages. In the ‘easy games’ a given amount c has to be distributed among the two players, whereas in the ‘complicated games’ the players have to allocate a bundle of black and white chips with different values for both players. We performed two main experiments for easy games as well as for complicated games. By a special experiment it was investigated how the demands of subjects as player 1 are related to their acceptance decisions as player 2."

abstract="Every year, automated negotiation agents are improving on various domains. However, given a set of negotiation agents, current methods allow to determine which strategy is best in terms of utility, but not so much the reason of success. In order to study the performance of the individual elements of a negotiation strategy, we introduce an architecture that distinguishes three components which together constitute a negotiation strategy: the bidding strategy, the opponent model, and the acceptance condition. Our contribution to the field of bilateral negotiation is threefold: first, we show that existing state of the art agents are compatible with this architecture; second, as an application of our architecture, we systematically explore the space of possible strategies by recombining different strategy components; finally, we briefly review how the BOA architecture has been recently applied to evaluate the performance of strategy components and create novel negotiation strategies that outperform the state of the art.",
